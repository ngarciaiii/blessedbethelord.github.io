  I created this site to write about my interests: startups and entrepreneurship, design, data-intensive applications,
  functional programming, AR/VR, and machine learning. I like to use computers to solve problems.

  I built this site in [Jekyll][jekyll], and it's hosted for free on [GitHub Pages][gh-pages]. It's open source, so if
  you like it, feel free to fork it on [GitHub][github] and make your own version.

  I'm a Brooklyn-based software engineer and entrepreneur currently at Google.

  I've founded a [couple][wirefreight] of [things][ppp]. Previously, I led the new products team engineering team at
  Phosphorus Genomics, analyzing genetic data and educating tens of thousands of people on their risks of developing or
  passing on genetic diseases.

  Away from the keyboard, I make food and music. I'm half of a band called [Cellolele][cellolele] and I once played in
  an ad for [Versace][versace].
